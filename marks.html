            Marks and skills both have importance in different areas of life. Here are a few key points about the importance of marks versus skills:

Marks, or grades, are typically used as a measure of academic performance in schools and universities. They are often used as a way to evaluate and compare students' knowledge and understanding of a subject.

Skills, on the other hand, refer to the ability to perform a task or activity effectively. These can include technical skills, such as programming or welding, as well as non-technical skills, such as communication and problem-solving.

In many cases, good marks in school do not necessarily guarantee that a person has the relevant skills for a particular job or career. Employers often place more value on skills and experience than on grades alone.

However, good grades can open up opportunities for further education and career advancement, and can serve as a marker of a person's intelligence and potential.

In the end, both marks and skills are important in different ways. Marks may provide an indicator of a person's knowledge and understanding of a subject, while skills indicate a person's ability to apply that knowledge in practice.

While grades are important for a student's academic progress, the skills and competences acquired through various activities, including extra-curricular activities, are equally important for their overall development.
