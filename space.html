                <li>Space is the vast, three-dimensional expanse that contains all matter and energy, including planets, stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies. It is often thought of as being empty, but in reality it is filled with a variety of particles and radiation.

                    He proposed that, in accordance with the laws of quantum mechanics, black holes emit radiation, now known as Hawking radiation. This radiation causes black holes to lose mass and energy, and eventually to evaporate.
